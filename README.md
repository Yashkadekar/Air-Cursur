# Air Cursor - Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse

A Python application that allows you to control your mouse cursor using hand gestures through your webcam.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, you'll need:

1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. Webcam
3. Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd air-cursor
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Required Packages

The following packages are listed in [requirements.txt](cci:7://file:///Users/yash/Documents/air%20Courser/requirements.txt:0:0-0:0):
- opencv-python
- numpy
- pyautogui

## Usage

Run the application with:
```bash
python aircursor.py
```

### Command Line Arguments
- `--fast`: Enable maximum performance mode
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode with visual feedback

## How It Works

The application uses computer vision to detect hand movements and translates them into mouse movements and clicks. It uses pre-trained models for hand detection and gesture recognition.

## File Structure

- [aircursor.py](cci:7://file:///Users/yash/Documents/air%20Courser/aircursor.py:0:0-0:0) - Main application file
- [hand.xml](cci:7://file:///Users/yash/Documents/air%20Courser/hand.xml:0:0-0:0) - Haar Cascade classifier for hand detection
- `hand_model.*` - Pre-trained model files for gesture recognition
- [requirements.txt](cci:7://file:///Users/yash/Documents/air%20Courser/requirements.txt:0:0-0:0) - List of required Python packages

## Troubleshooting

1. **Webcam not detected**: Ensure no other application is using the webcam
2. **Performance issues**: Run with `--fast` flag for better performance
3. **Installation errors**: Make sure you have the correct Python version and all dependencies installed

### Additional Recommendations:

1. **.gitignore**: Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude:
   ```
   __pycache__/
   venv/
   *.pyc
   .DS_Store
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**: Consider adding a section about setting up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Model Files Note**: Since the model files are binary and large, you might want to:
   - Either host them separately and provide download instructions
   - Or use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for better version control
